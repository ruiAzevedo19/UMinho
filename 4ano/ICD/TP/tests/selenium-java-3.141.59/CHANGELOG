  HttpClient.
* Fix an issue where RemoteProxy instances were causing an exception
  to be thrown if they weren't marked as a ManagedService.
* Deleting ability to run html suites with selenium-server-standalone,
  users are adviced to use htmlrunner

v3.9.1
======

* OkHttp backed instances can now connect to servers requiring
  authorisation. Based on PR #5444 proposed by @valfirst.

v3.9.0
======

* Switched to OkHttp for all HTTP communication. The version used can
  be changed back to the Apache HttpClient by setting the
  `webdriver.http.factory` system property to `apache`.
* Removed passthrough mode for the server.
* Grid: (implementation note) Start migrating servlets used to be
  command handlers.
* Upgraded every dependency to latest versions.

v3.8.1
======

* Fixed Chrome mutator injecting null binary path into new session payload.
* Added mutator that stips grid-specific capabilities hurting IE driver.
* Fixed SafariOptions construction from plain Capabilities object.

v3.8.0
======

* Dropped support for PhantomJS, it's recommended to use headless Firefox or
  Chrome instead.
* Node skips configurations that does not match current platform, no more IE
  slots on Linux-based nodes.
* Introduced unique ids for node slot configurations. Hub injects UID of the
  matched configuration to the new request payload. Node mutates capabilities
  with matching config UUID only. This allows to have multiple configurations
  for the same browser in node config file.
* Implemented matching of some browser-specific capabilities on Grid hub,
  namely "marionette" for Firefox (default is true) and "technologyPreview"
  for Safari (default is false).
* "technologyPreview" capability is now honored again by SafariDriver.
* Added initial support for managing Grid Hubs and Nodes via JMX
* Removed `Alert.authenticate` and supporting classes
* Better handling of configuring SafariDriver via capabilities.

v3.7.1
======

* Including httpcore in the packaged libs.
* Sending geckodriver logs to stderr by default. The default log level
  is low enough that the log does not look polluted. Geckodriver does
  not allow to separate its own log from the browser logs, so messages
  from the browser log can appear in the log even on the lowest level.
* Avoid sending the shutdown command to driver services that don't
  support it.
* Add support for customizing the Grid Registry.

v3.7.0
======

* Firefox and Chrome binary paths specified in Grid Node configs are
  now honoured.
* W3C spec compliant drivers need not return RGBA values for colours
  defined in CSS.
* Minimise disk usage when starting new remote sessions.
* SafariDriver and legacy FirefoxDriver can now be configured when
  using the remote server through Capabilities. Notably, this allows
  the Safari Technology Preview to be used if it's installed.
* Implemented the ability to configure the firefox log target using
  the driver service builder or a system property. Logs are sent to
  the null output stream by default. Fixes #4136
* Simulate some w3c Actions commands using the old APIs. This allows a
  local end that only speaks the JSON Wire Protocol to use
  "Actions.moveTo" when communicating with a W3C compliant remote
  end. Apparently, people need this.
* More fluent APIs in `*Options` classes.
* Moving some safari config options from `SafariOptions` to the
  `SafariDriverService`.
* In Grid and Remote, force the use of the legacy Firefox driver when
  marionette flag is set.
* The protocol handshake now uses a `CapabilityTransform` to convert
  an JSON Wire Protocol capability to one or more w3c
  capabilities. These are located using the standard Java
  ServiceLoader framework.
* The protocol handshake also uses a `CapabilitiesFilter` that
  extracts keys and values specific to a browser from a JSON Wire
  Protocol capabilities map. Again, these are loaded using the
  `ServiceLoader` framework.
* `requiredCapabilities` are now no longer sent across the wire.
* Fixed handling of unrecognized platform names returned by remote
  end. #4781
* Better error messages from the htmlrunner.
* Migrated from using `DesiredCapabilities` to either
  `MutableCapabilities` or (preferably) `ImmutableCapabilities`.
* Move building of locators to How enum


v3.6.0
======

* Remove direct dependency on HTMLUnit and PhantomJS from Maven
  artifacts.
* All `*Option` classes now extend `MutableCapbilities`
  `new RemoteWebDriver(new ChromeOptions());`
* Deprecating constructors that don't take strongly-typed `*Options`. 
* Improved exceptions when a `Wait` times out when using a
  `WrappedWebDriver`.
* Added `Interactive` interface to EventFiringWebDriver. Fixes #4589
* Add options to start Firefox and Chrome in headless modes.


v3.5.3
======

Important note:

* The new standalone server and Grid Node feature a "pass through"
  mode. If you see changes to the Selenium WebDriver "logging" APIs or
  automatic capture of screenshots on error (or if you want the old
  behaviour back) you can do so by executing:

  `java -jar selenium-server-standalone-3.5.3.jar -enablePassThrough false`

* Allow user-provided DriverProviders to override default providers in
  passthrough mode.
* Fixes issue with W3C Actions not being properly filled when multiple
  input sources are used.
* Platform that represent platform families ("WINDOWS", "UNIX", "MAC",
  and "IOS") return `null` from `Platform.getFamily`.
* Handle null return values from chromedriver. Fixes #4555
* Synchronized "platform" and "platformName" capability values. Fixes #4565
* Add iOS `Platform`.
* Fix wrapping of maps with null values. Fixes #3380
* Grid: Add new w3c compatible `status` endpoints for Hub and nodes.
* Grid: Properly parse responses from upstream nodes that are not
  200. Fixes issue where `NoSuchElementException` was mistaken for a
  `NoSuchSessionException`.
* Grid: Handle re-encoding issue when transferring text from the
  endpoint node to the local end.


v3.5.2
======

Important note:

* The new standalone server and Grid Node feature a "pass through"
  mode. If you see changes to the Selenium WebDriver "logging" APIs or
  automatic capture of screenshots on error (or if you want the old
  behaviour back) you can do so by executing:

  `java -jar selenium-server-standalone-3.5.2.jar -enablePassThrough false`

* Avoid encoding numbers as floats rather then longs in JSON payloads.
* New "pass through" mode supports file uploads again.
* Added support for querying running sessions via the
  "/wd/hub/sessions" endpoint
* Fix a NullPointerException when deserializing exceptions from a
  remote webdriver.
* Handle the `macOS` as a valid platform name, as this is used by
  safaridriver.


v3.5.1
======

Important note:

* The new standalone server and Grid Node feature a "pass through"
  mode. If you see changes to the Selenium WebDriver "logging" APIs or
  automatic capture of screenshots on error (or if you want the old
  behaviour back) you can do so by executing:

  `java -jar selenium-server-standalone-3.5.1.jar -enablePassThrough false`

* Bump guava to version 23. This is work around an issue where maven
  will select guava's android variant if using a ranged selector.


v3.5.0
======

Note: Never pushed to maven due to problems resolving guava version.

Important note:

* The new standalone server and Grid Node feature a "pass through"
  mode. If you see changes to the Selenium WebDriver "logging" APIs or
  automatic capture of screenshots on error (or if you want the old
  behaviour back) you can do so by executing:

  `java -jar selenium-server-standalone-3.5.0.jar -enablePassThrough false`

* Bump guava to version 22.
* Add support for a new "pass through" mode. This allows a connection
  from your test's RemoteWebDriver, through the Grid Hub, to a Grid
  Node, and down to a DriverService and thence the browser to use the
  same WebDriver protocol (the Json Wire Protocol or the W3C one) end
  to end without translation. This mode can be disabled by starting
  the standalone server or Grid node with `-enablePassThrough false`
* Pin Guava to version 21+. This fixes problems with lambdas being
  used as ExpectedConditions.
* Start making *Option classes instances of Capabilities. This allows
  the user to do:
  `WebDriver driver = new RemoteWebDriver(new InternetExplorerOptions());`
* Better handling of `getText` when confronted with a Shadow DOM
* Better logging when using an Augmenter fails.
* Make it easier to add new @FindBy annotations.
* Attempt to kill processes before draining input, error, and output
  streams. This should reduce apparent hanging when closing Firefox in
  particular.
* Grid will make use of W3C capabilities in prefernce to the JSON Wire
  Protocol ones.
* Fixing boolean command line arguments (#3877)

v3.4.0
======

* Geckodriver 0.16 is strongly recommended
* LiFT package is now available as a separate maven dependency.
* Deprecated numerous constructors on RemoteWebDriver that are no
  longer useful.
* `requiredCapabilities` are now being removed. Use
  `desiredCapabilities` instead.
* Legacy Firefox support broken out into a `XpiDriverService`, but
  still relies on the same `webdriver.xpi` as before.
* Better support for W3C endpoints

v3.3.1
======

* Better support for geckodriver v0.15.0. Notably, exceptions returned
  from the remote end are now unwrapped properly.
* Fix a bug with the status page of the standalone server.
* Deprecated `Capabilities.isJavascriptEnabled`


v3.3.0
======

* Support for geckodriver v0.15.0.
* Deprecated seldom used FirefoxDriver constructors.
* Added javadocs to show best way to create a new FirefoxDriver:
  ```
  DesiredCapabilities caps = new FirefoxOptions()
       // For example purposes only
      .setProfile(new FirefoxProfile())
      .addTo(DesiredCapabilities.firefox());
  WebDriver driver = new FirefoxDriver(caps);
  ```
* Stream New Session capabilities to disk before use to avoid eating
  every byte of available memory.
* Beginnings of local-end implementation of the w3c New Session
  capabilities. There's still some work to do.

v3.2.0
======

* Updated Guava to version 21 and started using Java 8 features. Users
  are recommended to update too.
* Fix a problem starting Firefox caused by missing libraries
* Experimental support for the W3C Action endpoints
* Remove deprecated `FluentWait.until(Predicate<?>)` method. This
  should make lambdas work properly with Wait instances now.
* Bump htmlunitdriver version to 2.24
* [Grid] Allow for customisation of TestSlot (#3431)

v3.1.0
======

* Update how the WebDriverException gathers system info. Resolves an
  issue with slow-downs on OS X Sierra.
* Update Wait and FluentWait for Java 8. Requires an update to the
  latest guava version 21.0
* Remove old marionette actions support.
* Selenium server now understands a "-version" flag.
* `WebElement.getText` now returns text from the Shadow DOM.
* Implemented a more straightforward way to specify firefox binary in
  GeckoDriverService builder.
* Firefox can now pick a channel to start from on Windows via
  `FirefoxBinary.Channel`
* ChromeDriver now supports `NetworkConnection` interface.
* htmlrunner bug fixes, in particular around `getValue`, and relative
  paths to the suite file.
* Fixes to make htmlrunner work.
* Removed native events from FirefoxDriver.
* Truncate the string representation of capabilities for display purposes.
* Implemented session storage for w3c codec.
* Change server dependency to htmlunit 2.23.2.
* [Grid] DefaultCapabilityMatcher now considers "browserVersion".
* [Grid] Fix node registration issue for Se2.x nodes with -servlets.
* [Grid] Windows nodes are no longer displayed as "mixedOS".
* [Grid] browser version capability specified on node command line no longer parsed to a Number

v3.0.1
======

* Include ElementScrollBehavior enum in the release.
* Add dependency on HTMLUnit to be included in the standalone server.
* Grid new session requests pass original request through to the node
  without any modifications.
* Fix NPE in htmlrunner when port is not specified.
* FirefoxDriver (legacy) fix to cleanup temp filesystem on quit (#2914 #2908).

v3.0.0
======

IMPORTANT CHANGES

* Firefox is only fully supported at version 47.0.1 or earlier. Support
  for later versions of firefox is provided by geckodriver, which is
  based on the evolving W3C WebDriver spec, and uses the wire protocol
  in that spec, which is liable to change without notice.
* You may wish to choose an ESR release such as 45.4.0esr or earlier.
* Firefox 47.0.0 is not supported at all.

Other major changes:

v2.47.0
=======

** Java 7 is now requried, but you really should be on 8, since 7 is EOL **


WebDriver:
* Supports native events for Firefox version 31 (immediately previous
  ESR). Native event support has been discontinued for versions of
  Firefox later than 33. Synthetic events tested on Firefox versions 31
  (immediately previous ESR), 38 (immediately previous release and current
  ESR), and 39 (current release).
* Beta Alert.AuthenticateUsing api implementation added, beta testing with IE.
* Added TakesScreenshot to WebElement.
* (provided by Microsoft) Added language bindings for Microsoft Edge browser
* Make it possible for users to override how the Lock is obtained with Firefox.
* (provided by Ahmed Ashour) Added implementation of Alert for HtmlUnit driver.
* (provided by Ahmed Ashour) Fixed findElementByXPath for HtmlUnit driver to
  work for XML pages.
* (provided by Ahmed Ashour) Fixed HtmlUnit driver to allow for manipulating
  elements in SVG documents.
* (provided by Ahmed Ashour) Fixed HtmlUnit driver so that deleteAllCookies
  deletes cookies only for the current domain, matching other implementations.
* (provided by Tamás Buka) Created an overload to
  ExpectedConditions.frameToBeAvailableAndSwitchToIt support to index and
  WebElement so that WebDriverWait can use this mode to switch frames.
* (provided by Joshua Bruning) Allow access to local profiler logs. An
  exception may be thrown if the WebDriver server does not recognize profiler
  logs. In this case, the user should be able to see the local profiler logs.
* (provided by Sergey Tikhomirov) Changed visibility of isDecoratableList
  method of DefaultFieldDecorator to protected for use with custom PageFactory
  implementations.
* Froze javascript.enabled property in Firefox profiles
* FIXED #426: (provided by Anand Jayaram) Default the hub port to 4444, if no
  port was provided.
* FIXED #638: Disabled HTTP Public Key Pinning (HPKP) when the
  webdriver_accept_untrusted_certs capability is set. As of Firefox 39, Firefox
  ignores certificate overrides if the domain's certificate is pinned.
* FIXED #644: (provided by Brett Randall) Modified ErrorHandler to tolerate
  non-Number lineNumber, and also attempts to safely parse a non-Number Object
  if it receives a non-Number. If absent or non-numeric it now continues to
  build the StackTraceElement (instead of aborting that frame) and uses the
  conventional -1 for lineNumber.
* FIXED #658: Disable reading list info panel in Firefox.

Server:
* Added a guard that prevents starting "IE instead of Opera" (or some other
  unwanted browser that obviously does not match the desired capabilities).
  Previously if a new session request is forwarded to a node it results in a
  driver instance creation in any case. For example, let's suppose a user
  starts a node with -browser browserName=opera option, and there is no
  operadriver in the classpath. Then the user requests a new remote driver with
  browserName=opera. The hub forwards the request to the node, and the node
  attempts to find the "best matching" driver provider. As far as opera is not
  available, it can start any other browser. Because "best matching" does not
  imply matching. The new guard prevents this unwanted behavior.

Grid:
* Added support to grid for Microsoft Edge driver
* (provided by Dima Kovalenko) Sort Grid Proxies in order of least busy to
  busiest. This should prevent situation where one node is running multiple
  sessions while several nodes are completely idle.

RC:
* Removed start of Firefox with -silent option to prevent crash in Firefox.

IDE:
* FIXED #570: Add ability to record elements that do not have href attributes.

v2.46.0
=======

Important changes in this release:

* Supports native events for Firefox version 31 (immediately previous
  ESR). Native event support has been discontinued for versions of
  Firefox later than 33. Synthetic events tested on Firefox versions 31
  (immediately previous ESR), 37 (immediately previous release), and 38
  (current release and current ESR).
* Remove all support from both webdriver and RC for Presto-based
  Opera. Blink-based Opera is still supported!
* Added beta Marionette driver (for Firefox OS and recent desktop
  releases).
* Fixing critical selenium server error caused by a user registering a
  driver class compiled with a higher Java version than the server is
  running (eg: server runs with Java 7, but the driver is comopiled to
  target Java 8)
* FirefoxDriver: now supported on OpenBSD (added by minusf@gmail.com)
* HtmlUnitDriver: Updated to HtmlUnit 2.17. Requires Java 7 or above to work.

Other notable changes:

* Added ability to clear file input fields for Firefox.
* Fix bug in Safari where Selenium updated the page under test in some
  circumstances.
* HtmlUnit: do not disable mouse notifications when js is disabled,
  css is also related to this information (only partly implemented in
  HtmlUnit at the moment)
* Updated htmlunitdriver to use htmlunit 2.17
* Upgraded commons-exec from 1.1 to 1.3
* Changed capability name from pageLoadingStrategy to pageLoadStrategy
* FIX: Google Code issue #7749: Add Get/Set network connection
  commands to JsonHttpCommandHandler to be able to use commands in
  selenium grid.
* Allow clients to specify TCP timeouts in the remote webdriver.
* Allow the chrome binary passed in capabilities to have a higher
  priority than node configuration.
* ChromeDriver: Added ability to pass whitelisted-ips option to the
  chromedriver
* Implement lazy loopback detection. This provides ~10x speed
  improvement of selenium server startup.
* Allow loading option descriptions from JSON file instead of
  Properties, allowing the server to manage order of options in the
  help message
* SafariDriver: In SafariDriver's page script, copy window properties
  to goog.global. (provided by juangj@google.com)
* Add a method toList that allows converting CompositeAction to JSON
* FirefoxDriver: Skip the profile cleaning step when launching Firefox
* Implement both integer (legacy) and string (standard) response status
  for the JSON wire protocol
* FirefoxDriver: Disable https://wiki.mozilla.org/Advocacy/heartbeat
  Firefox 37+ feature in browser sessions started by FirefoxDriver.
* FirefoxDriver: Added getters to FirefoxProfile to allow reading
  preset preference values
* PageFactory: Changed default value of how part of @FindBy annotation
  from ID to UNSET, but treat them equivalent to ensure backward
  compatibility
* PageFactory: Provide ability to use custom annotations. (Provided
  by Artem Koshelev)
* Use DaemonExecutor from commons-exec instead of DefaultExecutor.
  Fixes Google Code issue 4734. (Provided by Richard Atkins)
* FirefoxDriver and Java language bindings now handle both legacy and
  W3C specification dialects of element reference serialization in the
  JSON wire protocol.
* FirefoxDriver:  Don't force garbage collection in httpd.js for
  Firefox when connections are closed

v2.45.0
=======

Important changes in this release:

* Native events in Firefox relied on an API that Mozilla no longer
  provides. As such, fall back to synthesized events on recent Firefox
  versions.

Other changes:

* When Selenium is unable to interact with an element, such as the
  case when an element is missing or disabled, this change will output
  exactly how Selenium is attempting to locate the element, such as
  the XPath or id of the element. This greatly speeds up
  troubleshooting issues, as the exception message clearly states what
  element is broken/missing for common problems like an
  ElementNotFoundException.
* improve ByCssSelector#toString
* Remove automatic installation of the SafariDriver in Java.
* Complete Selenium Java Server support for Blink based Opera
* Upgrading PhantomJS driver
* Pull HttpClient implementation details out of HttpCommandExecutor.
* Fix issue 8254: Extensions were incorrectly transferred between
  Windows client and Linux grid node, because ZipEntry had incorrect
  name with '\' as separators.
* Adding capabilities and browser type for Opera Blink, and
  configuring tests to run in Opera Blink
* Adding support for Blink-based Opera to Java binding
* Adding Yosemite platform
* Allowing to set an arbitrary platform capability even if it can't be
  converted to Platform enum. Non-standard platform values can cause
  matching issues on Grid, but they can be usable for third-party Grid
  implementations
* Taking XML namespaces into account when searching by XPath. Checked
  to work in Firefox. Chrome supports namespaces out of the box. Need
  to update IE and Safari drivers to use the updated atom and test
  them carefully.

v2.44.0
=======

  * Updating Native events to support Firefox 24, 31, 32 and 33
  * Update calls to deprecated guava methods.
  * Remove the deprecated DatabaseStorage interface. And callers. Note that the browser implementations may still have an implementation of these interfaces, but nothing in the main project implements it so we should be okay.
  * Bump the version of guava to 18
  * Bringing MarionetteConnection in line with the current marionette state (FF33)
  * Add new tests for some wait conditions Also add the ExpectedConditionsTest to the test suite.
  * Update FindBy annotations description
  * Moving last part of browserlaunchers package from client to server
  * Moving Proxies utility class to server
  * Moving LauncherUtils to the server
  * Moving utility method isScriptFile to the only class where it is needed
  * Deleting tests for removed deprecated classes
  * Moving more RC stuff to the server
  * Moving tests too
  * Moving proxy management stuff to the server, it is used in RC browser launchers only
  * Using asMap as well as toMap to convert an object to Json
  * Using JsonNull.INSTANCE instead of null
  * Removing deprecated classes
  * Log stacktrace. Adds more info on catch to be put into the log instead of just console.  This will help debug issues when one has access to grid hub log but no access to console.
  * Remove unused static import of Ignore.Driver.HTMLUNIT.
  * Remove obsolete ChromeOptions code.
  * trim() HTTP response content because some drivers send back a response containing trailing null bytes, which the GSON parser does not like.
  * If JsonParser.parse() fails to parse a string obtained from a reflective call to a toJson() method, assume it is a primitive string.
        This is the case for, e.g., FirefoxProfile.toJson(), which returns a base64-encoded zip file. That string likely contains at least one '/', which the Gson parser rejects.
  * Fixing SessionId from json converter to better handle the case of null sessionId
  * Fix the Eclipse config. The new gson dependency wasn't added. Now is :) Also switched a call in HtmlUnitWebElement to use guava rather than commons-lang since that's already included in the build configs for both Buck and CrazyFun.
  * Get the Buck build working again.
  * HtmlUnit: add text to the end of input fields. This makes the htmlunit driver work as the other drivers do.
  * HtmlUnit: Fix getAttribute for dynamic properties.
  * Enable Html5CapabilitiesTest for HtmlUnit
  * Fix classpath for running tests in eclipse This allows the htmlunitdriver tests to run in Eclipse.
  * Fixing broken CrossDomainRpcLoader
  * Implementing autoconverion of platform in Capabilities on write
  * Moving from org.json to gson because the license. Fixes issue 7956
  * Revert "Bump the version of webbit to 0.4.15"
  * Optimizing finding multiple elements by id by using CSS selectors if available. Fixes issue 7682
  * Fixing WDBS compatibility with IE5. Fixes issue 7938
  * HtmlUnitDriver: Initial code cleanup.
  * Eclipse classpath fixes for htmlunit.
  * Deflake a test.

v2.43.1
=======

  * Fixing socketlock bug with reusing the same profile multiple times

v2.43.0
=======
WebDriver:

  * Updating Native events to support Firefox 24, 31 and 32
  * Add note on stale element checks and a WebElement represents a DOM element
  * Upgrade third party dependency JavaScript-XPath to 0.1.12
  * Fix example code: "using(-Chrome)DriverExecutable"
  * Make event_firing_test.html pass in Firefox 24 ESR.
  * Fix an error propagation bug when a command fails from bad inputs.
  * Handle the case where a proxied element from PageFactory causes a FluentWait to timeout.
  * Integrating the Microsoft Internet Explorer driver implementation
  * Allow subclasses of HttpCommandExecutor to extend it at runtime.
  * Handle the case where executeScript returns an HTMLDocument.
  * IEDriver crashes in WaitUntilElementFocused() because of null pointer. Fixes issue #7577
  * Deprecate the original RC interface in Selenium.
    As part of Selenium 3.0, we shall be moving the original RC interface to a
    legacy JAR that will be available as a separate download. As the first step
    in this process, the original "Selenium" interface is being marked as
    deprecated.
  * Run FirefoxDriver tests with Buck.
  * Bump timeout for tests since a suite is also a test.
  * Run htmlunit-driver tests with Buck.
  * Run the ignored tests printer with Buck.
  * Get org.openqa.selenium.SmallTests building with Buck.
  * Working around limitations in subpixel precision event handling.

    The bug/limitation where browser supports subpixel precision for elements but not for dispatched events was found in both modern Chrome (http://crbug.com/396380) and Firefox (?) browsers.
    (IE doesn't seem to be affected: before and including IE9 - no subpixel for elements and events; from ie10 - subpixel is supported for both elements and events).

    This test was lucky so far (mostly?) and didn't hit this issue, until Chrome 37 that enabled subpixel text scaling by default.

    This change makes *sure* elements have subpixel coordinates (if only browser supports'em) and then it makes sure this test doesn't fail because of that (while still testing selenium atoms).

    While there, I moved asserts from event handlers into the normal test flow so jsunit can properly attribute assertion failures to specific test methods.
  * Updating prebuilt libs for windows
  * Re-add the rubyzip jar
  * updating prebuilts for linux
  * Updating to gecko 32
  * Log formatter should be able to work with empty keys array. Fixes issue 7357
  * Fixing infinite read from socket. Fixes issue 7814
  * WDBS: safe check for window.localStorage
  * Driver should operate cookies for the current frame, not the topmost one. Fixes issue 7799 in
    Firefox

  * Adding more checks for JS functions removed from IE11. Fixes issue 7803
  * Fixing use of deprecated API in httpclient
  * Fixing use of deprecated API in guava
  * Update Closure library to head and compiler to the latest release
  * Implementing ability to use FirefoxDriver on a machine where localhost is not the first alias for
    127.0.0.1. Fixes issue 3280
  * Handle null and empty paths the same as /
  * fixing maven build, adding reference to jetty-rc-repacked-5
  * adding pom and info on uploading jetty-repacked-5 to maven central
  * Adding checks for JS functions removed from IE11. Fixes issue 7780
  * Deleting what appears to be unused deps.
  * Add more options to the Builder API (every common, settable capability should be covered).
    * Require calling Builder.usingServer(url) to use a remote server. If this is not called, the
     builder will attempt to create a client locally, throwing an error if it can't (e.g. for IE).
    * Add browser specific constructors to simplify creating a client without the Builder.
    Fixes issue 7593
  * Updating json-cpp lib and replacing mongoose web server with civetweb.
  * Safari is flaky. Reducing timeout to fail faster when we're going to fail.
  * Catch driver start-up failures.
  * Add explicit API for configuring log prefs rather than forcing users to rely on
    magic capability strings.
  * Clean up internal Firefox logging API.
  * Use LogLevelMapping to convert JSON wire protocol name to Level instance.
  * Make the jettyMaxThreads parameter actually be effective
  * Fix NullPointerException when File#listFiles() returns null. Fixes issue #1934
  * Making WDBS.start command a no-op if it was instantiated with an already started driver. Fixes issue 3993
  * Handling possible exception in stringification of window.location. Fixes issue 3908
* Modified IE driver server to more closely follow W3C spec

    This commit includes a number of changes designed to bring the IE driver
    into closer alignment with the W3C WebDriver specification. It provides
    no functional changes to the driver, nor does it change any external-
    facing API. The changes are:
     * Changed webdriver::Server to examine the response from the newSession
       command for the session ID rather than a two-stage process. The
       webdriver::Server::DispatchCommand method now calls the
       InitializeSession method directly when processing the newSession
       command.
     * Removed the now-obsolete webdriver::Server::CreateSession method.
     * Added a Serialize/Deserialize method pair on the webdriver::Command
       class (renaming the Populate method to Deserialize).
     * Revamped the serialization of webdriver::Command to use 'name' instead
       of 'command' for the command name.
     * Added a session ID member to the webdriver::Command object.
     * Modified the webdriver::Command object to no longer draw distinction
       between parameters passed in as part of the URL substitution and those
       passed in as part of the JSON payload in the body.
     * Modified webdriver::CommandHandler::ExecuteInternal (and all subclass
       implementations to use a single parameters map instead of the dual
       URL tokens/JSON payload parameters maps used previously.
  * Propagate webdriver_firefox_port preference to FirefoxDriver, was being ignored. Fixes issue 5172
  * Adding a new selenium server option -logLongForm to log more details to the console. Fixes issue 6645
  * Handling possible IllegalStateException while cleaning orphaned and timed out sessions. Fixes issue 6771
  * Setting forwarded content for CommandListener afterCommand handler. Fixes issue 7443
  * Fixing the list of extensions to search for an executable on Windows, and logging process startup
    errors. Fixes issue 7514
  * Setting layout.css.devPixelsPerPx to 1.0 if native events are enabled only. Fixes issue 7445
  * BODY element is always shown/displayed.
    related section in the W3C spec:
    https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/webdriver/raw-file/default/webdriver-spec.html#determining-if-an-element-is-displayed
  * Implementing switchToParentFrame support in atoms
  * Setting HtmlUnit to emulate FF24 by default
  * Updating HtmlUnit to 2.15
  * Stop polluting the log with stacktraces. Fixes issue 7460
  * Returning less specific platform info from firefox driver. Fixes issue 3354
  * Adding driver info into TimeoutException thrown by WebDriverWait. Fixes issue 7429
  * Implementing switchToParentFrame command for IE driver
  * Adding URL endpoint for switchToParentFrame

v2.42.2
=======
WebDriver:

  * errorHandler needs to be instantiated. Fixing NPE with IEDriver Issue #7415

v2.42.1
=======
WebDriver:

  * resorting context endpoints, belong with mobile spec
  * re-added Context endpoints to java client
  * allow custom ErrorHandler for HTTPCommandExecutor
  * fixing toJSON of chrome options where equal options become unequal.

v2.42.0
=======
WebDriver:

  * updating firefox prebuilts, thanks jleyba for fixing the build!
  * Use PRUnichar for Gecko < 29, char16_t otherwise.
  * Updating third_party/py/jython.jar to Jython 2.5.3
  * Removing unused functions
  * Implementing more straightforward way to send keyboard events in synthesized mode. Fixes typing into number inputs and rich text editors (like tinymce)
  * Fixing interactions API in Firefox to be able to move mouse to elements in frames using native events. Fixes issue 7253
  * Removing unused import
  * Refactoring: moving an auxiliary class from the top level to inner class
  * Removing outdated getValue command handler
  * Change ClearElement to be a subclass of WebElementHandler instead of WebDriverHandler
  * Removing outdated (unused) command constants
  * Fixing clicks on invisible elements in HtmlUnitDriver broken by ElementNotVisibleException being a subclass of InvalidElementStateException
  * Click after move with offset should use last mouse position
  * Adding new interface methods to the stubs
  * Preserve wrapped test function's string representation for Mocah's BDD interface.
  * Fixing IE driver to allow JavaScript objects with property names with spaces
  * Ignoring IE6-only test failure for CSS
  * Bump the hmltunit version to 2.14
  * Remove a class of our which replicates HTTP status codes already given meaningful names in the standard JRE.
  * Updating version match for native libs in firefox plugin manifest file
  * Updating native events dll for FF28
  * Implement ability to load driver providers using ServiceLoader. A user can add new providers or override existing ones. To use this ability a user should:
  * Refactoring the process of driver instances creation to use a new DriverProvider interface. DefaultDriverProvider wraps the current logic -- creating instances using reflection. This is a step to implement ability to load additional providers using ServiceLoader that can add new providers or override existing ones.
  * Ruby: Fix for extensions whose install.rdf uses an attribute for em:id (issue 5978)
  * fixes issue for locating newly installed chrome versions
  * Fixing IE driver crash when clicking on link that opens a new window.
  * Properly configure the http client in the presence of user credentials.
  * java json converter chooses Long (Number base class). Fixing RemoteNetworkConnection
  * SUPPORTS_BROWSER_CONNECTION was removed, missed a reference
  * Clean up use deprecated methods & classes.
  * ElementNotVisibleException is a type of InvalidElementStateException.
  * Tweak messaging on SafariDriver client page to better reflect what is happening. Also added a log message pointing users to the toolbar button that opens the driver log page.
  * Remove some no-op calls to deprecated functions.
  * Pull the logic for converting Command/Response pairs to and frame HTTP request/response pairs into a common codec instead of duplicating the logic on the client and server.
  * Change some tests to use Alert#accept() instead of Alert#dismiss() to get rid of alert dialogs. This is a workaround to ChromeDriver issue 764:
  * When running tests against the remote server, ignore two tests that use required capabilities. The remote server only supports desired capabilities on new session requests.
  * Update two tests to work when running with a remote server, where the original js error will be the root exception, but not necessarily the second error in the cause chain.
  * Test if we need to skip cookie tests for lack of a valid domain name before calling a method that asserts we have a valid domain name.
  * Convert HttpRequest/Response to POJOs; handle all conversion to and from HttpServletRequest/Response inside DriverServlet.
  * Every command handler returns ResultType.SUCCESS and those handlers that return an actual value do so through a level of indirection. This commit changes command handlers to just return results directly to the caller, making it possible to delete a lot of unnecessary code.
  * Move static resource serving code into DriverServlet. It is not part of the JSON wire protocol and including it in the command dispatcher complicates planned refactoring and other code cleanup.
  * Mobile - Network Connection implementation for Java and Python.
  * ChromeDriver 2.10.267517 binds to the loopback address instead of 0.0.0.0, so only attempt to connect using the loopback address.
  * Code comment changes for wait()
  * added task name to SCHEDULE_TASK event
  * Eclipse compiler update for Java 8 support
  * Updating naive user agent string checks to account for IE11
  * Adding Windows 8.1 detection to Platform.extractFromSysProperty
  * retry a test failure if there was a 'sauce' issue, like we exceeded the total time a test session is allowed to take.
  * adding Windows 8.1 platform, so we can use it in saucelabs for IE11 testing
  * Remove deprecated functions on webdriver.promise.Promise class * Use templates with webdriver.promise.Promise to improve types   documentation.
  * Loosen input type to webdriver.stacktrace.getStack_ to account for an rare condition in FF 28+ where the Error() constructor returns undefined (not sure what causes it, just know it happens)
  * Add ability to save an abitrary base64 string as a screenshot from a WebDriverJS test running in a browser.
  * When Firefox is configured to accept all SSL certs (which is the default behavior), we need to set a time offset to prevent Firefox from using HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security). If we don't do this, Firefox will pre-fetch the certs for sites that should always be accessed over HTTPS and allows Firefox to catch man-in-the-middle attacks. While this is A Good Thing for users, it prevents WebDriver from accepting self-signed certs for these domains (e.g. when they are accessed through a HTTPS proxy).
  * Remove unnecessary dependency on bouncycastle.
  * Making ChromeDriver directly implement the interfaces representing features it implements.
  * Updating build process for Firefox native events components to use gecko 29 SDK
  * Updating buck version to latest OSS release
  * Use addEventListener if possible. Fixes issue 6680
  * Packaging webdriven selenium (emulator) to client-combined jar. Fixes issue 7206
  * Don't use system path separators when computing URL paths.
  * Make Cookie serializable
  * Ignoring a test for HtmlUnitDriver that can't be run due to HtmlUnit restrictions
  * Allowing FindBy, FindBys, FindAll annotations on types
  * Minor cleanup FirefoxBinary.java
  * Adding Firefox native event version support to CHANGELOG
  * Adding version number to the capabilities returned by htmlunitdriver. Fixes issue 7110
  * Implementing augmentation indicator as an annotation
  * Error handling for startSession is handled in the parent class now.
  * Remove deprecated functions.
  * Revert "Fixing Java 8 incompatibility caused by use of old jruby" because it breaks java 7 compatibility :(
  * Fixing Java 8 incompatibility caused by use of old jruby
  * Export logging API from main webdriver module.
  * Setting pixel density to be independent from OS settings. Fixes issue 6112

v2.41.0
=======
WebDriver:
 * Update to support native events for Firefox 28 (removed native event
   support for Firefox 26). Native events are now supported for the
   following Firefox versions:

   17 (immediately previous ESR release)
   24 (current ESR release)
   27 (immediately previous release
   28 (current release)

 * Fixed capabilities to be sent properly encoded. For instance,
   capabilities for mobile have copyright signs.
 * Renamed some commands in the Firefox driver to prepare for Selenium
   3. This essentially means that we're mirroring the names of the
   commands in the function names within the driver. Also implemented
   handling a Selenium 3 style "sessionId" in a Command received by a
   Selenium 2 server.
 * Implemented support for switching context as described here:
   http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/browse/spec-draft.md?repo=mobile#133.
   This feature will be used by mobile WebDriver users to switch
   between different contexts like the native or the webview UI element
   tree. The feature is end to end tested with latest Selendroid
   snapshot version (6a126ab). In the langauge bindings, this is
   implemented as a role-based interface. Subclasses of RemoteWEbDriver
   that need this should extend TargetLocator and use covariant return
   types to keep everything happy and sweet.
 * Removed InternetExplorerDriver constructor that accepts
   WindowsProxyManager as a parameter. Proxy management moved to
   IEDriverServer and WindowsProxyManager is used for RC only now.
 * Removed use of VK_ENTER since its been removed from Firefox. PUA
   code uses VK_RETURN now like Mozilla Tools.
 * Added switch to parent frame command to the wire protocol and API.
 * Added httpOnly flag to Cookie JSON object.
 * (on behalf of Tobias Lidskog): Added property for silencing
   chromedriver. The Java property "webdriver.chrome.silentOutput" is
   now used to set the default value for silent mode in chromedriver
   using the ChromeDriverService class. This is analogous to the
   existing system property for controlling verbose mode.
 * (on behalf of Yi Zeng): Updated download link to googleapis.com
 * Reduced the visibility of a deprecated class in the htmlunit driver.
 * Removed deprecated FirefoxProfile.setProxyPreferences method.
 * Removed deprecated ChromeOptions.setExperimentalOptions
 * FIXED: 4843: (on behalf of Jonatan Kronqvist): Regard all modifier
   keys in SingleKeyAction. An earlier commit added META, but COMMAND
   and LEFT_* were left out as they were misinterpreted as aliases,
   which they aren't (they onlyuse the enum definition to get the same
   character code of the keys).
 * FIXED: 5331: Added javadoc to JavascriptExecutor executeAsyncScript
   about the default timeout. Also added some extra information on
   troubleshooting common issues.
 * FIXED: 7014: Fixed parameters parsing.
 * FIXED: 7033: Fixed javadoc.

WebDriverJS:
 * FIXED: 7105: Properly bind "this" for beforeEach/it/afterEach in
   mocha integration.

Grid:
 * Modified to ignore exceptions during the clean-up process if failing
   to start a RemoteWebDriver instance.
 * FIXED: 6770: Setting a timeout when Jetty has low resources to
   prevent hub from hanging.
 * FIXED: 6771: If a session times out and the browser was never
   started, it should still be cleaned up on the hub side.
   BeforeRelease should then be a no-op and not throw.
 * FIXED: 6772: Added a configuration parameter to set the number of
   threads Jetty uses. Default is -1, which implements the current
   behavior (255 threads from Jetty's default settings)
 * FIXED 6773: Consuming the request in all cases to properly release
   resources.
 * FIXED: 6811: Clean up immediately if starting a driver or session
   errors in RemoteWebDriver.
 * FIXED: 6878: Actually pass the response body to CommandListener
   implementations, per the interface contract.
 * FIXED: 7047: Updated a grid timeout property that seems to have been
   overlooked in a previous cleanup.

RC:
 * Added lost quotes in JSON format (RC).
 * Removed old version of Selenium RC emulation and leaving the new one
   in place.

v2.40.0
=======
WebDriver:
 * Update to support native events for Firefox 27 (removed native event
   support for Firefox 25).
 * Removed the iPhone driver. Also leaving the atoms available, so that
   appium and iosdriver can use them.
 * Deleted the client side of the AndroidDriver. Note that the atoms
   are still left in place so that Selendroid can still be compiled.
 * Make the RemoteWebDriver implement TakesScreenshot. There's only one
   driver that doesn't implement the interface (the HtmUnitDriver) and
   this is the most common cause for using the Augmenter, which isn't
   very discoverable.
 * Imported PhantomJSDriver 1.1.0, removing 1.0.4 (previous version).
 * Implemented augmentation of previously augmented instances
 * Fixed JdkAugmenter's inability to add interfaces that are already implemented
 * Removed org.openqa.selenium.net.INetAddress, an unnecessary abstraction
   around java.net.InetAddress.
 * (on behalf of Tobias Lidskog) Add ability to send --silent flag to
   chromedriver.
   when building an inverted predicate.
 * Implemented part of advanced user interactions using injected atoms
 * Fixed HtmlUnitDriver to handle timeout exception on refresh.
 * Implemented page load timeouts in Firefox without stopping page
   loading.
 * Implemented pageLoadingStrategy capability in Firefox.
 * Migrated the WebDriverBackedSelenium to
   com.thoughtworks.selenium.webdriven. This also leaves behind a
   deprecated implementation of each of the key interfaces to ease
   migration for users.
 * Implemented proper error code for the case of invalid css selector
   empty class name, and compound class name in atoms.
 * Implemented alert and confirmation handling in WDBS (Java)
 * Throw a more descriptive error when typing in certain types of input
   elements in Chrome. Starting with Chrome 33, certain types of input
   elements do not support the selection API (in fact, they throw when
   you try to access the property). This prevents us from fully
   simulating typing in the atoms.
 * FIXED: 2397: (on behalf of TommyBeadle) Fixed exception handling
 * FIXED: 3991: Add Keys.chord(Iterable<CharSequence>) as a utility
   method.
 * FIXED: 4606: Stop web page loading after timeout.
 * FIXED: 4843: (on behalf of Jonatan Kronqvist) Keys.META is now
   regarded as modifier key in SingleKeyAction. Keys.META, Keys.COMMAND,
   Keys.LEFT_ALT, Keys.LEFT_CONTROL and Keys.LEFT_SHIFT are now also
   regarded as modifier keys in SingleKeyAction (because of their
   aliases).
 * FIXED: 5397: Disabled validation of cookies loaded from the browser.
   If the browser could parse the cookie we are to be able to provide
   this information to the user even if the cookie is inalid.
 * FIXED: 5859: Implemented keyDownNative, keyUpNative and
   keyPressNative in WDBS. These commands are implemented via Actions.
 * FIXED: 6512: When the host is unknown, make the HtmlUnitDriver
   return an error page.
 * FIXED: 6657: Make the LoggingPreferences implement Serializable.
 * FIXED: 6681: Preventing augmentation of subclasses of RemoteWebDriver. Fixes
 * FIXED: 6830: (on behalf of GeorgeKlinich) Urlencoding result
   returned by server implementation of WebDriverBackedSelenium.
 * FIXED: 6834: Creating sesion cookie if expiry is not set. Fixes issue 6834
 * FIXED: 6947: Script timeout should get reset even when async
   callback is called synchronously.

WebDriverJS:
 * For consistency with Closure's new promise API, use thenCatch()
   and thenFinally() instead of addCallback(), addErrback(), et al.
 * ResultType.EXCEPTION and ResultType.ERROR are handled the exact same way,
   so remove one of them and simplify some code.
 * Treat promise.fulfill/reject as no-ops instead of throwing if the
   promise has already been resolved.
 * Added some utility functions to simplify working with arrays of
   promises.
 * FIXED: 6826: Add support for custom locators in webdriverjs.

Grid:
 * FIXED: 4589: Restrict the host where grid hub is listening if -host
   option is specified.
 * FIXED: 6445: Shorten string representation of capabilities in the
   hub log and grid console.

RC:
 * Deprecated browser launchers for dead versions of firefox.

v2.39.0
=======
WebDriver:
 * Update to support native events for Firefox 26.
 * Removed server side of iPhone driver.
 * Removed server-side of AndroidDriver and deprecating client side.

WebDriverJS:
 * FIXED: 6686: Changed Deferred#cancel() to silently no-op if the
   deferred has already been resolved.

v2.38.0
=======
WebDriver:
  * Update to support native events for Firefox 25.
  * Updated httpclient and httpcore maven dependencies
  * When moving the mouse relative to an element hidden in a parent's
    overflow region, that element must first be scrolled into view
    before the mouse move can be completed.
  * Removed WindowsProxyManager from InternetExplorerDriver, proxy
    management is implemented in IEDriverServer now.
  * The logging level for the FirefoxDriver's native components can now
    be set from the command line with the SELENIUM_LOG_LEVEL
    environment variable. Valid values are ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG,
    and TRACE. If the value is not set, or an unrecognized value is
    specified, the log level will be set to FATAL (which was the
    previous behavior).
  * Implemented ability to return Date object from executeScript
    (Firefox only).
  * Fixed Firefox returning the actual state of nativeEvents.
  * Made it possible to switch the webdriver.xpi from the command line
    using a system property.
  * Removed hardcoded chromedriver version
  * SafariDriver WebElement#getTagName() should return a lowercase
    string.
  * If ChromeDriver fails to start, suppress any exceptions from the
    subsequent "clean-up" quit() so the error from start is not lost.
  * Added an alternate, and Android-friendly, implementation of the
    Augmenter that uses JDK interface proxies instead of cglib. This
    new implementation is available as org.openqa.remote.JdkAugmenter;
    the default Augmenter implementation still relies on cglib.
  * Prevented an infinite loop when computing overflow state when the
    documentElement has fixed position.
  * Improveed logging for UnixProcess#destroy().
  * If an error is thrown while typing a key sequence, return that
    error to the client. Prior to this change, the driver would
    effectively hang.
  * Do not attempt to generate a key event if the target element is no
    longer attached to the DOM. nsIPressShell (which is used to
    dispatch events) will throw a generic NS_UNEXPECTED_ERROR if we
    fail to make this check.
  * FIXED: 3107: (On behalf of Ross Patterson) Preventing possible NPE.
  * FIXED: 4501: (On behalf of Robert Ambrus) Introduced a system
    property org.openqa.jetty.SocketListener.bufferSize that allows to
    set the size of the buffer Jetty uses for network communications.
  * FIXED: 4698: Added missing expected conditions.
  * FIXED: 5295: User defined element properties should be retrievable
    with getAttribute.
  * FIXED: 5900: Revamped the SafariDriver's internal networking.
  * FIXED: 6294: Implemented ability to switch to a frame by id or name
    in WDBS.
  * FIXED: 6358: Disabled Content Security Policy in Firefox.
  * FIXED: 6414: Fixed the way EventFiringWebDriver unwraps the
    underlying driver.
  * FIXED: 6431: Catch an exception thrown if the chrome executable is
    not found and stop chromedriver before propagating it.
  * FIXED: 6445: Shortened Firefox profile textual representation in
    capabilities.
  * FIXED: 6473: Implemented ability to pass --verbose option to
    chromedriver.

WebDriver JS:
  * Always annotate errors for rejected promises
  * FIXED: 6284: Omit x/y offsets from the mouseMove command instead of
    defaulting to (0,0).
  * FIXED: 6471: Correctly document the contract on
    WebElement#getAttribute
  * FIXED: 6612: On Unix, use the default IANA ephemeral port range if
    unable to retrieve the current system's range.
  * FIXED: 6617: Checking for Error.captureStackTrace is sufficient to
    determine if an environment supports stack traces. This avoids
    unnecessarily triggering debuggers configured to halt when an error
    is thrown.
  * FIXED: 6627: Safely rebuild chrome.Options from a partial JSON spec.

Grid:
  * FIXED: 6357: Added PhantomJS icon to the grid console.
  * FIXED: 6392: Removed misleading log messages.

RC:
  * FIXED: 1666: Fixed typo in RegExp.test function name.
  * FIXED: 1758: Ignoring closed windows when collecting attributes
    from all windows (RC).
  * FIXED: 2508: Fixed screenshot size calculation for quirks mode (RC)
  * FIXED: 2845: Moved storedVars from test case level to test suite
    level.
  * FIXED: 3185: Fixed JSON converter (RC).
  * FIXED: 3270: Fixed switch to window by var= locator (RC).
  * FIXED: 5103: Fixed screenshooter in Firefox and Selenium RC,
    limiting the size of the screenshot to pevent failures.
  * FIXED: 6496: Enabled .htm and .xhtml extensions for test suites.

v2.37.0
=======
  * Fix Firefox native event support on Linux for 23 & 24.

v2.36.0
=======
WebDriver:
  * Updated Firefox native event components to support Firefox 24.
  * Updated HtmlUnit to 2.13.
  * Updated HttpClient to 4.3.
  * Updated version of Guava to 15.
  * Updated version of wgxpath.
  * Return an empty string instead of "null" when the browserName and
    version capabilities are not set.
  * Stop propagation of the webdriver-evaluate custom event when
    executing user supplied JavaScript. Without this change, the event
    handler will trigger twice for async scripts, causing the driver to
    attempt to evaluate the user script twice, leading to unpredictable
    behavior.
  * Added a new pause action to the interactions API.
  * Improved support for using the HTML5 APIs through the remote
    server by augmenting the session driver before attempting to
    access HTML5 capabilities.  If the driver does not support the
    requested feature, throw an UnsupportedCommandException instead of
    a ClassCastException.
  * Implemented elementScrollBehavior capability in FirefoxDriver.
  * Fixed getLocation to work on scrolled pages.
  * Fixed autoscrolling for elements located in frames.
  * Fixed drag-n-drop for elements in frames in Firefox with native
    events
  * Implemented SOCKS proxy support for FirefoxDriver
  * Fixed support for SVG documents in the atoms.
  * Fixed computing an element's container dimensions to account for
    the scrollbar size when scrolling
  * FIXED: 2670: Made subclasses of By serializable.
  * FIXED: 6200: Pass command line arguments to the Selenium server
    instead of to the JVM.
  * FIXED: 6293: Added more informative error message.
  * FIXED: 6346: Allow args to passed to the JVM using the jvmArgs
    option.

Grid:
  * Added ability to fetch slotCounts from /grid/api/hub. The resource
    looks like this:

        { "slotCounts": { "total": 20, "free": 8 } }

  * Added ability to fetch newSessionRequestCount from the
    /grid/api/hub resource.


v2.35.0
=======
WebDriver:
  * Updated Firefox native event components to support Firefox 23.
  * Removing deprecated interactions interfaces (Keyboard, Mouse,
    TouchScreen).
  * Updated operadriver to 1.4.
  * Introduced ie.setProxyByServer capability to select how IE browser
    proxy will be set up, either by old Java code using Windows
    registry or inside IEDriverServer using WinINet methods. This
    capability is marked as deprecated and will be removed in future
    versions. In the future, IE proxy settings will be set up only by
    IEDriverServer. Current default value of ie.setProxyByServer is
    false so Windows registry will be used for IE proxy setup.
  * Guarded around IE returning an empty object for the active element.
  * FIXED: 6055: Fixing "invalid xpath" issue, actually invalid NS
    resolver.

WebDriver JS:
  * FIXED: 6079: The parent process should not wait for spawned driver
    service processes (chromedriver, phantomjs, etc.)

v2.34.0
=======

WebDriver:
  * Updated Firefox native event components to support Firefox 22.
  * Update synthesized mouse implementation. Mouse moves are
    implemented using nsIDOMWindowUtils.
  * Finding libX11.so.6 in a slightly more intelligent way: Check that
    dlopen actually succeeds, if not found in one of the fixed paths,
    look in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
  * Added ExpectedConditions to check for the visibility of all
    WebElements in a List
  * Updated the wgxpath library.
  * Updated our copy of the Closure compiler and library to the most
    recent versions.
  * Updated the atoms library, including support for MS pointer events
    and refinements to element visibility tests.
  * Close all open connections when stopping the SafariDriver server.
  * Fall back to a loopback address if the current machine does not
    have an external IP address (as will be the case when there is no
    internet connection).
  * Remove sizzle dependency from the firefox driver. We only needed
    this for versions of firefox prior to 3.5, which we no longer
    support.
  * Fixed Select.escapeQuotes method.
  * Added SafariOptions and support for custom Safari extensions.
  * Moved Mouse, Keyboard and TouchScreen to the interactions package
    where they belong. This has the benefit of also making our build
    files simpler once we delete the original versions which have been
    deprecated.
  * Deprecated the HasTouchScreen interface.
  * Fixed condition in Select.select_by_index method to fix case when
    selection is performed by index on a multiple select element.
  * Implemented an alpha version of a Marionette (WebDriver implemented
    natively in Firefox) driver.
  * Deprecated IPhoneDriver.
  * Added support for the HTML5 "hidden" attribute. If an element, or
    ancestor, has hidden attribute make, it is not shown.
  * FIXED: 2285: Allow setting default logLevel for standalone-server.
  * FIXED: 5609: Adding the ability to redirect firefox process output
    to file.
  * FIXED: 5669: Add Driver#remote_status for the Ruby remote driver.
  * FIXED: 5715: Adding toString method for the event firing
    webelement.

WebDriver JS:
  * When capturing console output, guard against user scripts that
    redefine the console global.
  * Improved logging in the test client.
  * Use goog.labs.testing.assertThat for the assertThat library.
  * Improved stack trace handling
  * Defined a webdriver.Capabilities class for webdriverjs.
  * Added native ChromeDriver support to WebDriverJs.
  * Mark discarded tasks as cancelled to prevent hanging on
    asynchronously scheduled callbacks.
  * Include the webdriverjs tests in the built npm package. Updated
    the README with instructions for running the tests using npm.
  * Add native PhantomJS support to webdriverjs.

Grid:
  * Update grid for change in behavior of WebDriver's new session
    command.
  * Fixed handling of JSON conversion errors at node.
  * FIXED: 5942: Fix hang of hub when node machine is not available.

RC:
  * Fixed RC tests failing in Firefox beta builds. This has been fixed
    in two ways:

    * Rely on the automation atoms where possible.
    * Obtain the document and window from the element the event is
      firing from.

    In the course of fixing this, all but one usage of "triggerEvent"
    was replaced. Because of this, the method has been inlined to the last
    call site.
  * FIXED: 1646: UTF-8 encoded user-extensions.js support.


v2.33.0
=======

WebDriver:
  * getText() ignores elements in the <head>
  * Bundled OperaDriver version bumped to 1.3.
  * Added a FindAll annotation for the PageFactory to use.
  * Added a toString() implementation to Color.
  * Deleted the Selenium-backed WebDriver.
  * FIXED: 2218: IE >=9 versions triggerMouseEvent like other
    browsers.
  * FIXED: 2610: Implementing ability to specify path to the chrome
    executable in the node configuration file using chrome_binary
    capability.
  * FIXED: 2685: Increasing port range for Firefox to chose from when
    starting.
  * FIXED: 4790: Improvements made to Firefox startup in highly
    concurrent environments.
  * FIXED: 5045: Added support for fetching logs from SafariDriver.
  * FIXED: 5652: Adding unhandled alert text to the exception message.
  * Added LogType.PERFORMANCE, supported in chromedriver2 0.9+.

WebDriver JS:
  * FIXED: 5511: Implement
    driver.manage().timeouts().pageLoadTimeout(ms) for WebDriverJs.
  * FIXED: 5632: It's now possible to create a new session with
    WebDriverJs when running in a browser.
  * Add a WebDriverJs client to the SafariDriver's logging window so
    it's possible to use WebDriver from the devtools REPL on that
    page.

Grid:

  * Making "beta" console the default one, it's time to get out of
    beta status
  * Old console is now available at /grid/old/console/
  * Addressed memory leaks caused by per-session logging.
  * FIXED: 3001: Making Selenium the default protocol if a node was
    started with "-role rc" option.

RC:
  * FIXED: 3636: selenium.fireEvent works with the webdriver-backed
     selenium and IE.

v2.32.0
=======

WebDriver:
  This release supports Firefox verions: 10esr, 17esr, 19, 20

    to element and allows JavaScript execution
  * Fixing case of "no active element" for HtmlUnitDriver
  * WindowsUtils.kill() fix on Windows 8
  * Updating HtmlUnit to 2.12 (and cssparser to 0.9.9)
  * Fixing illegal negative timeout values for HtmlUnitDriver, zero
    means infinite wait
  * Implementing pageLoadTimeout in HtmlUnitDriver
  * Allow users to specify a custom location for Safari's data
    directory using the "safari.dataDir" capability.
  * Fix for using DesiredCapabilities with WebDriverBackedSelenium
  * PhantomJS Driver bindings updated to 1.0.3
  * Minimize the number of third party libraries used by the very
    heart of the remote webdriver server.
  * fix issue where server was appending '?null' to all forwarded
    requests
  * Issues fixed: 5293, 4902, 5283, 5278

v2.31.0
=======
  (summary not created, check version history logs)

v2.30.0
=======

WebDriver:
  * Fixing a bug introduced by a change in how we get already logged
    messages from the console service in firefox. This allows us to
    function with firefox 19
  * FIXED: 1181: Improved loopback detection
  * FIXED: 1627: Implementing ability to use auto proxy in
    HtmlUnitDriver.
  * FIXED: 3652: moveToElement with offset should consider 0 as a
    valid value, not as "undefined".
  * FIXED: 3868: Better ephemeral port range selection.
  * FIXED: 4107: Added prebuilt version of the SafariDriver extension
    to the client jar.
  * FIXED: 4821: WebDriverBackedSelenium works when added to project
    via maven.
  * FIXED: 4940, 5075: Added iceweasel to list of firefox variants.
  * FIXED: 5022: Text node with overflow:hidden and height/width 0 to
    not be visible since we cant see them.
  * FIXED: 5030: Only send files to upload, not directories.
  * FIXED: 5079: FluentWait.until(Predicate) method does not propagate
    predicate message.
  * FIXED: 5109: We should show elements visible if there is a pixel
    visible.
  * Semi-private change: Changes in the Coordinate class.

JS:
  * Update WebDriverJS to support parallel flows.  This change renames
   several low-level classes and functions in the promise module:

      promise.Application                                 -> promise.ControlFlow
        #schedule(string, function)                       ->   #execute(function, [string])
        #scheduleTimeout(string, number)                  ->   #timeout(number, [string])
        #scheduleWait(string, function, number, [string]) ->   #wait(function, number, [string])

    The old schedule* functions are still present, but will print a
    warning message if called. They will be removed in 2.31.

RC:
  * Added ability to use relative path to an -htmlSuite file.
  * FIXED: 3498: Proxy based browsers are back to normal on HTTPS
  * FIXED: 5113: Implementing GET requests support for RC protocol.


v2.29.0
=======

WebDriver:
  * Firefox 18 support.
  * IEDriver supports "requireWindowFocus" desired capability. When
    using this and native events, the IE driver will demand focus and
    user interactions will use SendInput() for simulating user
    interactions. Note that this will mean you MUST NOT use the
    machine running IE for anything else as the tests are running.
  * Use the "webdriver.remote.shorten_log_messages" system property to
    reduce the verboseness of ouput from executeScript and
    executeAsyncScript when using the RemoteWebDriver.
  * Switching HtmlUnitDriver default from FIREFOX_3_6 to FIREFOX_10
  * SafariDriverExtension should restore Safari's previous settings on
    shutdown.
  * Bundled version of PhantomJSDriver bumped to 1.0.1
  * Updated the version of guava-libraries used to 14.
  * Updated HtmlUnit to 2.11
  * Deprecated XPathLookupException in favour of
    InvalidSelectorException
  * FIXED: 3602: Changing IE view port calculations to allow for
    always-present vertical scroll bar, and to test for horizontal
    scroll bar and adjust as required by page content.

v2.28.0
=======

WebDriver:
  * "null" can now be passed to executeScript
  * .Net: Corrected FileUtilities.FindFile() to correctly return the
    current directory if the specified file is located there.
  * .Net: Introduces the Updating the CustomFinderType property to the
    .NET FindsByAttribute. This allows use of custom By subclasses in
    the PageFactory. The custom finder must be a subclass of By, and
    it must expose a public constructor that takes a string argument.
  * SafariDriver: better attempts to catch native dialogs from user
    defined onbeforeunload handlers.
  * Updating HtmlUnit to 2.11
  * Added the PhantomJS bindings to the release. You'll still need to
    download PhantomJS itself separately.

RC:
  * Implemented getAllWindowNames in WebDriverBackedSelenium
  * Implemented openWindow in WebDriverBackedSelenium to allow opening
    relative URLs


v2.27.0
=======

WebDriver:
  * Added support for native events for Firefox 17.
  * Added support for ghostdriver (PhantomJS)
  * Adding new capability "enableElementCacheCleanup" to the IE
    driver. When set to true, the IE driver will clean the
    known-element cache of invalid elements after every page
    load. This is intended to keep memory usage down and improve
    performance. However, it is an intrusive change, so this
    capability is provided temporarily to allow disabling this
    behavior if problems arise. The default of this new capability is
    "true", meaning this behavior is turned on by default.
  * Added shift key handling to the synthetic keyboard actions.
  * Modifying scroll behavior in IE driver SendKeysCommandHandler to
    call Element::GetLocationOnceScrolledIntoView() instead of calling
    the DOM scrollIntoView() function. Should result in less page
    scrolling during test runs.
  * Checking if CSS transforms on elements, or their parents, are
    hiding them and therefore returning they arent visible.
  * Add not, refreshed, invisibilityOfElementWithText to
    ExpectedConditions.
  * Added support for new IE10 pointer events.
  * FIXED: 1543: Allowing equal sign in a cookie value.
  * FIXED: 2103, 3508: Modified to no longer hang on alerts triggered
    by onchange of <select> elements or by onsubmit of <form>
    elements.
  * FIXED: 2035: Returning a simple result (null) after opening a new
    window instead of the window object (that can't be serialized to
    JSON).
  * FIXED: 2353: Only call blur() for IE if the element is not the
    <body> element.
  * FIXED: 3043: Better error message reporting when browser launch
    fails.
  * FIXED: 4490: Checking script evaluation result to prevent null
    reference exception.
  * FIXED: 4736: Added all of the extended colour keywords to the
    Colors enum in support of
    http://www.w3.org/wiki/CSS3/Color/Extended_color_keywords.
  * FIXED: 4800: Fixed calculation of coordinates for elements in
    frames/iframes where the element is scrolled out of view within
    the frame.

Grid:
  * FIXED: 3818: Generating session identifiers with UUID to prevent duplication.

RC:
  * FIXED: 4668: Fixing ability to open relative URLs in WDBS.
  * FIXED: 4273: Added getCssCount to the list of the methods
    supported by WebDriverBackedSelenium.
  * FIXED: 4055: WDBS implementation of getValue for radio buttons now
    reflects behaviour of RC.
  * FIXED: 4784: Processing locators before use in getCssCount and
    getXpathCount.

=======
WebDriver:
  * Updated OperaDriver to 0.15.
  * Added transparency support to the Color class.
  * Increased lock time a bit for the FirefoxDriver to make tests more
    stable on Windows.

    whether to use the persistent hover thread in the IE driver. Defaults
    to true for IE.
  * Added support for native events for Firefox 15 and 16.
  * Removed deprecation from ChromeDriver constructors that take a Capabilities
    object. Also added a method to set experimental options in ChromeOptions
    which may be used to set options that aren't exposed through the ChromeOptions
    API.
  * Fixed SafariDriver to allow calling .quit() consecutively without error.
  * Modified FirefoxDriver to use atoms to switch between frames.
  * FIXED: 4535: Hover still does not work perfectly in IE.

    dialogs. Currently not implemented in any drivers.
  * Warn users that the IE driver will no longer use the DLL in the
    next release.
  * Deprecated browser specific WebElement subclasses.
  * Added support for "requiredCapabilities" to the remote webdrivers
    and implemented basic support for these in the firefox
    driver. Failure to fulfull a required capability will cause a
    SessionNotCreatedException to be thrown.
  * Added the ability to determine how unhandled alerts should be
    handled. This is handled by the "unexpectedAlertBehaviour"
    capability, which can be one of "accept", "dismiss" or
    "ignore". Java code should use the UnexpectedAlertBehaviour
    enum. This is only implemented in Firefox for now.
  * Allow native events to be configured in Firefox and
    (experimentally) in IE using the "nativeEvents" capability.
  * Updated supported versions of Firefox to 17.

=======

Project:
  * Code grant from Google acknowledged in our copyright
    headers. Thanks, Google!

WebDriver:
  * JRE dependency upped to Java 6.
  * IE driver now uses the IEDriverServer. You may need to download
    this. Set the "useLegacyInternalServer" to boolean true if you
    need the old behaviour.
  * Standardized colour values returned from getCssValue are
    normalized to RGBA.
  * IE can use synthesized events if the capability
