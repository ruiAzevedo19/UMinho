/**
 * First-order logic revision exercises based on a simple model of a 
 * file system trash can.
 * 
 * The model has 3 unary predicates (sets), File, Trash and
 * Protected, the latter two a sub-set of File. There is a binary 
 * predicate, link, a sub-set of File x File.
 *
 * Solve the following exercises using only Alloy's first-order 
 * logic:
 *	- terms 't' are variables
 *	- atomic formulas are either term comparisons 't1 = t2' and 
 * 't1 != t2' or n-ary predicate tests 't1 -> ... -> tn in P' and 
 * 't1 -> ... -> tn not in P'
 *	- formulas are composed by 
 *		- Boolean connectives 'not', 'and', 'or' and 'implies'
 *		- quantifications 'all' and 'some' over unary predicates
